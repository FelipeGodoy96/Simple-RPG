# Simple RPG
Welcome, 
this is a simple RPG I made from scratch, no copy, did all this by studying basic concepts and applying it to this project.

#How it works?
Just download the file and run it into your Java editor file. I prefer InteliJ but you can use other of your preference.

#Instructions
The game runs all by terminal console, so you need to first insert your desired character name and then choose between option 1 or option 2 (option 3 is to be implemented yet).
